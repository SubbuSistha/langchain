# Structured Output in LLM

## 📌 What is Structured Output
- Making LLM return **well-defined format** instead of free text
- Output follows a **schema (JSON / object / class)**

👉 Think: Instead of paragraph → **machine-readable data**

---

## ❌ Without Structured Output
- Free-form text response
- Hard to parse programmatically
- Inconsistent formats
- Breaks automation pipelines

---

## ⚠️ Pain Points Without It
- ❌ String parsing (regex / hacks)
- ❌ Format changes → code breaks
- ❌ No type validation
- ❌ Hard to integrate with APIs / DB

---

## ✅ Where Used
- AI Agents
- API response generation
- Chatbots (structured replies)
- ML pipelines
- Automation workflows
